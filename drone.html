                        <h5>The purpose of your quadcopter propellers is to generate thrust and torque to keep your drone flying, and to maneuver.<br> The upward thrust force generated by the propellers is usually measured in pounds or grams. To keep your
                            drone flying at a hover, the upward thrust needs to equal the weight of your drone.<br>The thrust to weight ratio TWR (thrust divided by weight), indicates how much thrust your drone generates relative to its weight. A good
                            rule of thumb is to design the TWR to be at least a value of two.<br><br> Typically, quadcopter propellers produce more thrust the faster they spin. They are also influenced by the flight dynamics of your quadcopter. Some propellers
                            produce much more thrust when the drone is stationary, as opposed to when it is flying. Other props perform much better at higher speeds.<br>
                            <img src="How-to-choose-best-racing-drone-frame.jpg" class="collapsible_image" alt="image is here"><br> Torque is generated when the propellers accelerate up or down. This force is responsible for the ability of the drone to
                            rotate on the yaw axis.<br><br>Torque is an effect of Newton’s third law, where every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
                            <br>As the propeller rotates, and pushes through the air, the air pushes back and causes a counter rotation on the body of the drone.<br>This is why all of the propellers on a multirotor drone do NOT rotate in the same direction
                            (see Figure 1). The counter rotation effect of all propellers cancels out, and you have no rotation. By changing the relative RPMs of the motors, you can cause a yaw rotation of the drone.<br><br> Your drone has two different
                            types of propellers and motors. One set is designed to spin clockwise, while the other is designed to spin counter clockwise. Be sure to identify which ones are which.

                    <h4>Factors to Consider When Selecting Drone Propeller Blades:</h4>
                </button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <h5>There are a number of factors that should be taken into consideration when choosing the right drone propeller blades. Drone propeller blades have a significant influence on power and can affect how smoothly a drone flies. Therefore,
                            one of the most important considerations is flight efficiency – how will new drone propeller blades improve the flight efficiency of your multirotor UAV?<br> When selecting new drone propeller blades, the following factors
                            are important:<br>
                            <br>Number & Size of Blades:-<br> The number of blades required per propeller will vary depending on the platform, usage and payload requirements. Smaller blades, under eight inches, are most frequently used for racing drones
                            and those used for acrobatics. Smaller blades are generally paired with smaller motors with high kV ratings.<br> Larger blades, over eight inches, are paired with motors that have low kV ratings and can be used to carry heavier
                            payloads, such as video equipment or spraying containers for agriculture.<br>
                            <br>Pitch:-<br> Pitch is defined as the traveling distance per a single revolution of the propeller. The correct pitch will often depend on the specific application for a UAV platform. Lower pitch often results in more torque
                            and less turbulence for lifting, and as a result the motors do not have to work as hard to carry heavy payloads which can result in increased flight time (as the motors will draw less current from the battery).<br> Propellers
                            with higher pitches move more air, but generally create more turbulence and less torque.<br>
                            <br>Diameter:-<br> Typically, a larger diameter propeller blade allows greater contact with the air. This relates directly to flight efficiency, as a small increase or decrease in diameter can change how efficiently a drone
                            performs. Larger propellers tend to be more stable when hovering than smaller propellers.<br> However, smaller propeller blades require less effort to speed up or slow down than larger ones, making them more responsive than
                            larger propellers.<br> Smaller propellers with a high pitch are better suited for fast and quick maneuvers, while larger propellers with low pitches are more appropriate for carrying heavier payloads and aerial video cameras.<br>
                            <br>Other factors to be considered include:-<br> Blade material<br> Power
                            <br> RPM
                            <br> Air density<br> Maximum noise<br> In summary, selecting the most appropriate propeller blades for a VTOL UAV will vary depending on the planned usage and there are a number of factors that need to be taken into consideration.

                    <h4>Quadcopter Propeller Pitch:</h4>

                    <div class="content">
                        <h5>The quadcopter propeller pitch is a measurement of how far that a propeller will move through the air for every single rotation of the motor/propeller. This is only a theoretical approximation since real world factors such as prop
                            material, air density, and efficiency can influence this distance. However, the pitch is a good measurement that will help you better understand your propeller performance.<br> The higher the pitch value, the faster your plane
                            will go.<br> To better understand the effect of propeller pitch, imagine two wood screws as shown in Figure 2. The screw on the left has a coarse thread (higher pitch), and the screw on the right has a finer thread (lower pitch).
                            If you were to take a screwdriver, and screwed both into a piece of wood by making sure you turn the screwdriver at the same speed for both screws, you would notice that the screw with the coarser thread (higher pitch), would
                            sink into the wood more.<br><br> This is the same effect as a propeller cutting through the air.<br> In the figure, the two arrow lines show the position of the propeller tips. You can see that the high pitch propeller covers
                            the same distance travelled with only half the rotation of the propeller. With both motors/propellers spinning at the same RPM, the higher pitch propeller will travel further in the same amount of time. In other words, the
                            plane with the higher pitch propeller will fly faster.<br> Changing the propeller pitch will also change the dynamic response of your quadcopter.<br><br> To produce the required thrust, a quadcopter propeller needs to be designed
                            to be within a specific range of pitch angles. An almost flat propeller will be just as bad as a steep pitched propeller, that is it will not generate any lift.<br> The flatter the blade, the easier it is for the motor to rotate
                            the blade through the air. Toy grade or low-end quadcopters are equipped with low power motors. These motors need to spin faster to create lift, but higher RPMs are easier to generate with a smaller motor than torque.

                        <h5>Two bladed propellers are more efficient at producing thrust as opposed to three or four bladed propellers (see Figure 5) so long as the tips do not reach supersonic speeds. For the purposes of quadcopter propellers, this is not
                            a problem.<br> Adding blades increases the amount of thrust that is generated, but at the cost of efficiency.<br> You will see many drones that have 5-inch triple blade propellers. The aerodynamic environment of drones negates
                            the inefficiencies of tri-blades in the 5-inch size. Tri blades also have a higher torque generation which makes the yaw axis of the quadcopter much more responsive.<br> There are 4, 5, and even 6 blade designs, but these have
                            diminishing returns due to inefficiency.

                        <h5>Propellers are usually made from a plastic compound, though carbon fiber propellers are also available. The type of material used to make the quadcopter propeller affect its stiffness and durability.<br> Most hobby drone pilots
                            are using durable plastic propellers that are slightly flexible and bend when your drone crashes. This allows them to last much longer, and save you money in the long run. These propellers have a disadvantage of causing vibration
                            as they rotate, which can affect the flight performance of your drone.<br> Carbon fiber propellers have a number of advantages, and disadvantages. They produce less vibration due to their stiffness, and sound quieter when flying.
                            They are much lighter, and are stronger than plastic propellers. However, they are expensive, and the inflexibility means the motor bearings will take the brunt of the impact force on crashes.

                        <h5>For better flight performance, you want to go with lighter propellers as opposed to heavier ones. Lighter props have less moment of inertia, which means the motor needs to apply less torque to generate the same RPM. This also results
                            in faster RPM changes which leads to better drone flight response.<br> The weight distribution greatly affects the amount of vibration that the propeller will generate. A perfectly balanced prop will produce next to no vibration,
                            while an unbalanced prop will affect the flight performance, and will sound terrible.

                        <h5>The more surface area that a propeller has, the more air it can push thereby creating more thrust. The downside is higher current draw, increased drag, and reduced power efficiency. Bull nose propellers are more commonly being
                            used on modern quadcopters (see Figure 6).<br> Bull-nose quadcopter propellers have a greater surface area, and create more thrust. Tapered propellers create less tip vortices, but sacrifices thrust as the propeller gets thinner.
                            These are better suited for slow moving quadcopters where stability is more important for applications such as aerial photography.<br> The added surface area of the bull-nose propeller means that you are adding weight, especially
                            further away from the hub. This increases the moment of inertia of the propeller, and requires the motor to apply more torque, drawing more power from the battery.<br> Bull-nose propellers are commonly used on small racing
                            frames to gain a higher thrust at a smaller size.

                            mounted on a drone motor that rotates clockwise. A propeller with a C designation is to be mounted on a motor that rotates counter-clockwise.

                            There is a slight advantage that a foldable propeller has that a fixed prop doesn’t. On a fixed prop, when you push the throttle to high, all the motor torque is transferred to the propellers. With a foldable propeller, there is a bit of an absorbing
                            effect that helps to cushion the impact on your drone. This will quickly balance out and the full torque will be applied to the propeller. The cushioning effect is beneficial to reduce shock impact on the camera.

                        <h5>If your quadcopter has crashed, be sure to take a careful look at the propellers for any damage. A few scrapes on the propeller are ok, but flying with nicked propellers will make it nosier, and increase vibration. This will have
                            the effect of shortening the life of the motors, since the bearings will rotate as if they are unbalanced.<br> The quickest way to check for any damage is to run your fingers along the leading edge of the propeller. If you
                            feel any major nicks, then it’s time to replace the propeller.<br> Be sure to keep a few extra propellers on hand if they need to be replaced. Most quadcopters that you buy come with extra propellers.<br> Remember, that there
                            are two different directions that the propeller can rotate (see previous section). Be sure that you are mounting the correct propeller on the right motor.

                            in real flight as compared to the bench tests.<br> Be sure to take this into account when you are sizing your propeller and drone motor.

                        <h5>Standard Propellers:<br> The propellers are usually located at the front of the drone/quadcopter.<br>There are very many variations in terms of size and material used in the manufacture of propellers. Most of them are made of plastic
                            especially for the smaller drones but the more expensive ones are made of carbon fiber.<br>Propellers are still being developed and technological research is still ongoing to create more efficient propellers for both small
                            and big drones. Propellers are responsible for the direction and motion of the drone.<br>It is therefore important to ensure that each of the propellers is in good condition before taking your drone out for flight. A faulty
                            propeller means impaired flight for the drone and hence an accident.<br>You can also carry an extra set of propellers just in case you notice some damage that was not there before.<br><br> Pusher Propellers:<br> Pusher propellers
                            are the ones responsible for the forward and backward thrust of the drone during flight.<br>As the name suggest, the pusher propellers will determine the direction the drone takes either forward or backward. They are normally
                            located at the back of the drone.<br>They work by cancelling out the motor torques of the drone during stationary flight leading to forward or backward thrust.<br>Just like the standard propellers, the pusher propellers can
                            also be made of plastic or carbon fiber depending on the quality. The more expensive ones are usually made of carbon fiber.<br>There are different sizes depending on the size of the drone. Some drones provide for pusher prop
                            guards that will help protect your propellers in the event of an unplanned crash.<br>Always ensure you inspect your pusher propellers before flight as this will determine the efficiency pf the flight.

                        <h5>Let’s talk fancy for a moment, let’s talk variable pitch propellers. Fairly uncommon for this level of flying machine, it may have occurred to you earlier that finding a balance has its limitations. Like a swimmer in the water,
                            there are times to push hard and there are times to float along.<br> On an airplane, the wings have flaps. Extend these flaps to create both more surface area and a greater angle of attack to drastically change how the aircraft
                            performs, i.e. it can maintain flight at much lower speeds.<br> A helicopter, on the other hand, will not have flaps on its propellers, instead it twists the blades, changing the angle of attack only.<br><br> This can be true
                            of your drone propellers as well. We do not know of a retail solution as yet, but we’ve seen this technique in some prototype commercial drones. The idea, mostly, is to utilize the best angle to use the least amount of battery
                            possible at any stage of flight, all without compromising performance.<br> Imagine, if you will, if you could change the overall size, texture and pressure of the tires on your car, all while you are driving. That is as close
                            to the same concept as I can think of right now. Hard smooth tires would provide the best fuel efficiency on the highway, but the worst amount of suspension and grip. Big soft tires with lugs for tread would ease your passage
                            over large rocks or bad pot holes, but would be horrid for fuel costs on the highway. We find the balance on our cars as we find the balance in our drone propellers.

                        <h5>For the most part, drone propellers consist of two blades. You’ve seen this on airplanes as well, smaller craft usually have two bladed propellers, larger craft may have three or four blades. For our purposes, we’d like to make
                            blade count a sub-category of the surface area discussion – more blades produces more surface area per rotation, after all.<br><br> Have you ever stirred water in a pot or bucket? As you get the water moving faster and faster
                            around in a circle it becomes harder to make an impact on the fluid. Let’s think of splashing of the water as if it were smooth flight. When the water is sitting still or moving slowly, you dip your hand in and move the water
                            – it is at this point that your action has the most impact and creates the most splash. If you put two hands in, on opposite sides, notice how the rotation creates less splash?<br>Then, as I say, if you are just getting started,
                            things splash a lot, but once moving around quickly, you reach the point where you have minimal impact on the water, you’re just moving your hands to keep up with the flow.

                        <h5>There are two parameters that determine the drone motor size for your quadcopter:<br> 1. Your quadcopter total weight<br> 2. Your quadcopter frame size<br> If you are building your drone, you may not know the final weight. However,
                            you can determine the final weight by considering the weight of all of the individual components.<br> The aggregate weight of your quadcopter can be your best guess, as you haven’t constructed it yet. It should include everything:
                            frame, flight controller, PDB, wires, motors, battery, payload (for example, HD camera and gimbals), and so on.
                            <br> The frame size will let you determine the proper propeller size to use.<br> Once you know the propeller size and the weight of the drone, you can determine how much thrust the individual drone motor needs to generate to
                            get your quadcopter into the air.<br>

                            The thrust to weight ratio TWR = T / W is the main dynamic characteristic that will determine your drone flight profile.<br> To maintain steady flight, your TWR needs to be equal to one (see Figure 1). However, to take off
                            you will need TWR > 1 so you have a net acceleration upwards.<br> When flying, the angle of attack of the drone (ie the tilt angle alpha in Figure 2) causes the thrust vector to have vertical and horizontal components.<br>This
                            requires the TWR to be at least 1.3 for an approximate maximum angle of attack of 40 degrees.<br> A general rule is that the motors should be able to provide twice as much thrust as the total weight of the quad. If the thrust
                            provided by the motors is too little, the quad will not react well to your control and may even experience issues on takeoff.<br> For instance on the off chance we had a quadcopter that weighs 1kg, the aggregate thrust created
                            by the motors at 100% throttle should be no less than 2kg, or 500g for each motor (which is multiplied by 4 for a quadcopter).<br> This will give you better control, as well as the space for including additional payload later
                            on (like heavier cameras, or possibly additional batteries to extend flight time).

                        <h5>The size of brushless motors are normally indicated by a 4-digit number of the pattern XXYY. The XX represents the motor stator width, while the YY represents the motor stator height. Both dimensions are in millimeters.<br> A taller
                            stator provides more power at higher RPM, while a wider stator provides more torque at lower RPM.<br> Also, a larger stator height means a bigger permanent magnet size (see Figure 6), while an increased stator width means a
                            larger electromagnetic coil size.<br> The size of the prop shaft on the motor determines the size of the propeller that can be used. Motors with a M5 (5mm diameter) motor shaft are designed to be used with 3”, 4” 5”, and 6”
                            propellers.
                            <br> The kV motor specification is the number of revolutions per minute that the motor will turn when one volt is applied with no load on the motor. When you attach a propeller, you will get a reduction in the number of RPMs
                            due to added inertia of the propeller, and air resistance. Higher kV motors will spin the propeller faster, but lower kV motors will generate higher torque.<br>This is why larger propellers are paired with low kV motors, in
                            order to provide the increased torque needed to turn the propellers. High kV motors are used for smaller, and lighter propellers.<br> 2204 and 2205 are common motors that are used on quadcopters. A good propeller matching for
                            thee motors are:<br> 2600 kV and higher motors for 4” propellers<br> 2300-2600 kV for 5” propellers<br> 2300 kV and lower for 6” propellers<br>

                            KV is another essential parameter. It is the theoretical increase of motor rpm (rotation per minute) when the voltage goes up by 1 volt without load. For instance, while running a 2300KV motors with a 3S LiPo battery (12.6V), the motor would turn at around
                            28980 rpm. (2300 x 12.6V = 28980) This is only an estimation.<br> In any case, once you mounted a propeller on the motor, the rpm won’t be that high because of the props resistance. Higher KV motors
                            would turn the propeller quicker with less torque, and lower KV motors create higher torque with less rotation. Bigger props are matched with low KV motors, and smaller props with high KV motors.<br> It’s important to discover
                            a balance between rpm and torque when picking motor and propeller.<br> By matching high KV motors with excessively large propellers, the motors will try to turn them quickly like it would do with smaller props, and this will
                            draw a lot of current and produced an excessive amount of heat.

                            as it approaches its maximum limit. You will be wasting battery energy and drone flight time with less efficient motors.<br> To get a higher thrust, the motor will need to draw more current. The best combination for a drone
                            motor is high thrust with low current draw. Inefficient motors generate too little thrust, or use too much current.<br> Typical drone motor efficiencies have a value of 7.

                </button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <h5>In selecting an ESC, it is important to think about 3 main considerations. The 3 considerations for ESC choice include:<br> Motor size: The size of the motor will greatly dictate the amount of amperage your ESC must be able to
                            handle.
                            <br> Propeller: Choice of propeller will also dictate what amp rating your ESC should be. Will your drone be spinning 3, 4, 5, or 6 inch propellers? What kind of performance will you want, and therefore what kind of propeller
                            pitch will you use?<br> Battery: Will you be using a 3 cell battery, or a 4, 5 or even 6 cell battery? ESCs are rated for amperage, along with battery cells.<br> Let’s say for example you are interested in drone racing. Modern
                            racing drones are nearly all using 5 inch propellers with a high pitch. For these high-pitch propellers to spin at high RPM, pilots will select a motor with specifications such as 2207, 2450kv. This motor with an aggressive
                            pitched prop can pull upwards of 40 amps. Therefore, selecting the right ESC is important so that the FETS on the ESC don’t become damaged from the amperage and fail mid-race. Therefore, it is a good idea to design your drone
                            for your specific need and application. Selecting an ESC for voltage, however, is much more straightforward, in that ESCs have ratings on them indicating the battery voltage (S) they can handle. Generally, for a 4S drone running
                            5 inch propellers, an ESC capable of 30 amp sustained current will work for nearly all applications like freestyle and racing.

                </button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <h5>ESCs receive a throttle signal from the flight controller. For many years this was a pulse width-modulated signal (PWM) which told the ESC how fast to spin the motor. Modern flight controllers and ESCs however communicate with
                            much faster digital protocols, called D-Shot. The ESC will receive the signal from the flight controller and translate that signal into motor RPM. This change in motor RPM can happen incredibly fast, in part due to the rapid
                            rate of communication between the flight controller and ESC, and also due to the connection between the ESC and the motor. An FPV Drone Electronic Speed Controller utilizes onboard microprocessors and therefore require firmware
                            to control the hardware. This firmware can dictate which protocol your flight controller will use to communicate with your ESC. Depending on the type of ESC you have there are currently a few types of firmware:<br> BLHeli:
                            This is found on older 8-bit ESC’s. It is capable of running oneshot protocols. The 8-bit microprocessor of later models, called the F390, is capable of the faster analog signal Multishot.<br> BLHeli_S: This is also found on
                            8-bit ESC’s, but the hardware is more modern, running quieter and able to run all protocols (Oneshot, Multishot) up to D-Shot 600.<br> BLHeli_32: This is a relatively new firmware which will run on the new 32-bit ESCs. It is
                            capable of the faster iterations of D-Shot, like D-Shot 1200, and has things like telemetry.<br> KISS: This is a proprietary ESC firmware that will only run on KISS ESCs. It is capable of Oneshot and D-Shot, and has telemetry
                            and other features.<br> This firmware is user-upgradable. Settings on the ESCs can be changed using software available on both Macs and PCs.

                            <div align="center"><img src="F1-Flight-Controller-naze32.jpg" class="collapsible_image"></div>
                            F1 processor is the oldest processor and has the lowest processing capability of all the above processors. It is actually an outdated processor with Betaflight ending support to F1 FC’s in 2017.<br> F3 Processor:-<br>
                            <div align="center"><img src="betaflight-f3-flight-controller.jpg" class="collapsible_image"></div>
                            F3 was essentially a F1 FC with increased number of UART’s (It is discussed in detail below) and increased flash memory (memory used to store the FC’s firmware codes). Some smaller FC’s use this processor even now because of their compact size and exceptional
                            processing power.<br> With developments in Betaflight optimizations taking place constantly, F3 processors are having a hard time keeping up.<br> F4 Processor:-<br>
                            <div align="center"><img src="f4-flight-controller-cc3d-revo.jpg" class="collapsible_image"></div>
                            F4 was a giant leap in mini quad processors with more than double the processing power that of an F3. But there are limitations with F4 processors with no support for smartaudio natively which is not a big deal for most people. Still F4 FC’s are the most
                            popular choice for their functionality and affordability.<br> F7 Processor:-<br>
                            <div align="center"><img src="betaflight-f7-flight-controller.jpg" class="collapsible_image"></div>
                            F7 processor is the big daddy of mini quad FC’s. F7 FC’s became available mid of 2018 and these are the most recent processors. F7 FC’s are packed with upto 8 UART’s which can be used for telemetry, GPS, camera control etc.., F7 FC’s come with dual Gyros
                            (MPU6000 which is noise resistant and ICM20602 which can run 32K gyro sampling).<br> Obviously F7 is more future proof and more and more Betalight developments are going to be geared towards optimizing
                            the processing power on an F7 processor.

                        <h5>Betaflight, Cleanflight, Raceflight, KISS are some of the major flight control firmware’s widely used in flying a mini quad. Each firmware is optimized for a particular function.<br> Betaflight:-
                            <br> Betaflight is the most popular option with its easy GUI (graphical user interface) and under constant development by its developers. Betaflight is flexible and a powerful flight controller firmware perfect for a beginner
                            which requires little to no coding experience. Another major advantage that Betaflight has is that it supports a large number of flight controllers.<br> Raceflight:-
                            <br> Another flight control firware is Raceflight, focused entirely for acro and racing drones. Raceflight stands out by deleting non essential codes (like GPS). By deleting these codes Raceflight freed up processing power
                            which can be used to do other useful functions like running faster looptimes for example.<br> If you’re only into racing, Raceflight is the firmware to choose. But beware when selecting, flight controllers such as the Revolt
                            F4 are capable of running Raceflight.<br> KISS:-
                            <br> KISS (keep it simple stupid) is a closed source firmware developed by FlyDuino. KISS products are powerful and up to date with the current trends on the market. Similar to Raceflight, KISS is also closed source and runs
                            on proprietary boards from KISS. If you like Apple products despite its higher price point then KISS is the Apple of the mini quad world.

                        <h5>Hardware is probably one of the most important aspects to consider when selecting an FC. Hardware of a flight controller decides how well a quad performs because quality components assure accuracy, efficiency and performance.<br>                            IMU- Gyroscope & Accelerometer:-<br>
                            <div align="center"><img src="drone-flight-controller-gyroscope-accelerometer.jpg" class="collapsible_image"></div>
                            IMU stands for inertial measurement unit. IMU consists of Gyroscopes (gyro in short) and accelerometers. A single IMU chip contains Gyro’s and Accelerometers. Since most pilots fly acro mode, accelerometers are turned off.<br>                            Gyroscope is a sensor placed in FC’s which helps to determine the angular orientation or tilt of the quad.<br> There are 2 major Gyros used in the world of quadcopters. They are the MPU6000 and ICM20602. F4 FC’s use MPU6000
                            gyros, while F7 FC’s use ICM20602 and some FC’s have dual gyro setups featuring both the ICM20602 and MPU6000 which can be switched according to the user preferences.<br> The MPU6000 gyro was launched in 2010 by InvenSense.
                            This is an older gyro which is reliable and more noise resistant than ICM20602 with gyro sampling capability at 8KHz. ICM20602 is a much latest gyro by InvenSense which is much more sensitive and has the capability to sample
                            gyro at 32KHz.<br> The sensitivity of the ICM20602 might be a good thing and an equally bad thing. Technically the ICM series gyro must perform better because of their sensitivity but not necessarily. The mechanical vibrations
                            from the motors require the FC to soft mount the gyro and the electrical noise from motors and ESC’s require the addition of capacitors to counter electrical noise. But when properly setup the ICM20602 can do better than the
                            ICM6000 in every way.

                        <h5>The receiver is the unit responsible for the reception of the radio signals sent to the drone through the controller.<br>The minimum number of channels that are needed to control a drone are usually 4. However, it is recommended
                            that a provision of 5 channels be made available.<br>There are very many different types of receivers in the market and all of them can be used when making a drone.<br> A Radio Receiver is the device capable of receiving commands
                            from the Radio Transmitter, interpreting the signal via the flight controller where those commands are converted into specific actions controlling the aircraft.<br><br> A radio receiver, or RX, is the device that receive commands
                            from the radio transmitter. It will then pass the signal to the flight controller and that’s how you control a drone.<br> It’s important to know that a TX normally only works with radio receiver (aka RX) from the same brand,
                            and the same “TX protocol”. For example, a Frsky Taranis TX won’t work with a Spektrum receiver.<br> The “TX protocols” (I sometimes call it “air protocol”) is like a language spoken between the transmitter and receiver, and
                            different brand have different protocols. Even within the same brand they might have different protocols.<br><br> When you buy a TX, you need to realize that you are also locking yourself into their receivers. This becomes
                            an important consideration: some brands of receivers are more expensive than others; some brands might have a better selection of light weight receivers for mini quad; Some brands don’t have certain features such as telemetry….
                            etc…
                            <br> Remember, you are going to put a receiver in every quad you build so this adds up quickly in the long run if you ever build more drones.

                            with two antennas to ensure the best reception.<br> The main wire is the antenna active element which receives radio signals via a specific frequency. Length of the active element depends on the frequency and is exactly 1/4th
                            of the wavelength for a specific frequency.<br>Length of the antenna wire is not fixed; only active elements has to be at specific length. As am example, the wavelength for 2.4GHz transmission is 122mm. 1/4th of that equates
                            to 30.5mm for the active element.<br> Receivers usually come with two antennas for 2.4GHz Frequency. <br>To achieve the best signal reception it is recommended to keep them at a 90degree angle in relation to each other when
                            installed on the multi rotor.

                        <h5>PWM – Pulse Width Modulation:-<br> This is the most common and basic radio control protocol. In the old days when there were only RC fixed wings planes, the receivers were used to control the servos or ESC directly with standard
                            PWM signal, one channel for each servo. Until today the same technology is still being used in many models.<br> Multirotors require at least 4 to 5 channels (sometimes even more) and you will see the same numbers of servo leads
                            connected between the receiver and flight controller.<br> PWM stands for pulse width modulation. It’s an analog signal where the length of the pulse specifies the servo output or throttle position. The length of the signal
                            pulse normally varies between 1000µs and 2000µs (micro seconds), with 1000µs being the minimum & 2000µs the maximum.<br> PWM radio receiver is the most common and usually the cheapest option. However due to the messy wiring,
                            hobbyists now prefer PPM or SBUS over PWM.<br><br> PPM – Pulse Position Modulation:- PPM is also known as CPPM or PPMSUM. The advantage of PPM is that only one signal wire is needed for several channels (typically 8 channels
                            max), instead of a number of individual wires. So you should only connect the ground, power and signal cable.<br> A PPM signal where basically a series of PWM signals sent one after another on the same wire, but the signal
                            is modulated differently.<br> PPM is what they call “analog signal in time domain” (although it can be a bit controversial at times), channels are sent one after another and not at the same time. Therefore it’s not as accurate
                            or jitter free as serial communications, but it’s more widely available and supported by many Flight controllers.<br> Check out this post for a more detail difference between PWM and PPM.<br><br> PCM – Pulse Code Modulation:-
                            PCM stands for pulse code modulation, it’s a data types similar to PPM. However PCM signal is digital signal (using ones and zeros) while PPM signal is analogue, which is the length of time the signal is on. PCM has the potential
                            of signal error detection even error correction, but this still depends on the product you buy.<br> PCM is more reliable and less susceptible to interference, but additional conversion is required so the equipment tends to
                            be more expensive.<br><br> Serial Protocols:- Serial Receiver is a digital loss-less protocol that uses only 3 wires (signal, power, ground) for multiple channels. As the name suggests this type of receiver requires serial
                            port on the flight controller. This includes SBUS, XBUS, MSP, IBUS, and SUMD.<br><br> SBUS (S.BUS, Serial BUS) – By Frsky, Futaba:- SBUS is a type of serial communication protocols, used by Futaba and FrSky. It supports up
                            to 18 channels using only one signal cable.<br> SBUS is an inverted UART communication signal. Many flight controllers can read UART input, but cannot accept inverted one (such as the Naze32 Rev5) and an inverted is required.
                            However F3 FC’s and some FC such as Pixhawks has built-in dedicated signal inverter for this purpose.<br><br> CRSF (Crossfire):- CRSF is a new protocol developed by TBS. It’s similar to SBUS or other digital RX to FC protocols.
                            The main advantages include faster update rates and two-way communication capabilities, allowing things like Telemetry to be injected into the communication stream with no additional ports required. This allows FC-tuning through
                            your radio as well as hassle-free telemetry to your remote control via the Crossfire radio link.<br><br> IBUS – By Flysky:-<br> IBUS is the new flysky serial protocol. It’s a two way communication which means it can send and
                            receive data: one port for servo data output and one port for sensors.<br><br> XBUS – By JR:-<br> XBUS is used by JR, which supports up to 14 channels in one signal wire. One of the advantages is the tiny time delay between
                            each channel.<br><br> MSP (multiwii serial protocol):-<br> Protocol that was created as part of the multiwii software. Basically it allows you to use MSP commands as the RC input and it supports 8 channels in one signal cable.<br><br>                            Graupner Hott SUMD:-<br> The Graupner SUMD is a serial protocol like Speksat and SBUS. The channels are encoded into one digital signal and have no noticeable latency. Advantages of SUMD are:-<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Compared to SBUS, SUMD doesn’t require signal inverter</li><br>
                                <li>Compared to PPM, SUMD has better resolution and no jitter while PPM has only 250 steps and always 4ms jitter.</li>
                            </ul><br><br> Graupner SumH:-<br> SUMH is a legacy Graupner protocol. Graupner have issued a firmware updates for many recivers that lets them use SUMD instead.<br><br> FPort:-
                            <br> FPort is a new RX protocol developed by Frsky and Betaflight developers. It combines both the control signal and telemetry data into 1 single wire which makes it more compact and easier to manage.<br> It’s not inverted
                            like SBUS and Smart Port so it should be compatible with F4 without hardware inverters.<br> F-Port is still at its very early stage. We will surely release more info about FPort, and how to set it up on our quad in the future
                            as we hear more.

If the receiver has an accurate clock, it seems like it should be a simple case of distance = time x speed. However, there is a problem with this approach.<br>                            The first problem is the need for synchronized clocks. Each GPS satellite has four atomic clocks, two cesium and two rubidium, providing time accuracy of one second in 100,000 years. The receivers have much less accurate clocks
                            and have to compensate for the time taken to receive the signal.<br> Radio waves only travel at the speed of light in a perfect vacuum. The Earth’s atmosphere distorts and delays satellite signals. This effect must also be

                            minor perturbations cause a variation to the known orbit, but this is compensated for by ground based measurements of the satellite orbits. This information is available to the satellites, which is transmitted along with timing

                            same logic can also be applied to air traffic control. Over the next decades, GPS will reduce the need for radar aircraft tracking systems.<br> Emergency first responders can benefit from GPS navigation, which can provide the
                            shortest and fast route to the scene. Farmers are now using GPS systems in farm equipment to manage and harvest crops more efficiently. Farm animals, pets and wildlife can be more easily tracked using GPS collars. Visually
                            impaired people, who have traditionally relied on seeing dogs, greatly benefit from having talking GPS modules.

                        <h5>The US GPS satellites is but only one of several global satellite navigation systems. In 1982, the Soviet Union launched the GLONASS GPS satellites, which Russia continues to operate. Europe is developing the Galileo GPS system,
                            while China is developing its own Compass GPS satellites. There are a few smaller GPS constellations including China’s BeiDou, and India’s IRNSS. Typically, a GPS receiver only receives signals from one of these satellite systems.<br>But
                            there is no reason why one can’t use signals from multiple sources. The distribution of the US GPS satellites is such that at least four satellites are visible from any location. Combining signals from GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo
                            can greatly increase the positional accuracy determination, and eliminate the problem of tall buildings blocking signals. The more satellites that are in view of the receiver, the greater the positional accuracy.<br>There are
                            several drone modes XXXXXX that utilize both the US and Russian GPS satellites, thereby increasing navigation robustness. The ability to utilize multiple GPS sources is a highly advantageous, and is a feature you should look
                            for when buying a more advanced drone.

                            satisfied. Also, they have low-self discharge rate, which is about 5% per month.<br><br> Radio controlled equipment and aircraft:-<br> LiPo batteries are now almost ubiquitous when used to power radio-controlled aircraft, radio-controlled
                            cars and large scale model trains, where the advantages of lower weight and increased capacity and power delivery justify the price. Test reports warn of the risk of fire when the batteries are not used in accordance with the

                            a maximum 4.2V/cell, for powering certain R/C vehicles and helicopters or drones.Some test reports warn of the risk of fire when the batteries are not used in accordance with the instructions.<br> LiPo packs also see widespread
                            use in airsoft, where their higher discharge currents and better energy density compared to more traditional NiMH batteries has very noticeable performance gain (higher rate of fire). The high discharge currents do damage the

                            it is possible to use a large number of cells of small capacity to obtain required levels of power and energy to drive a vehicle, some manufacturers and research centres are looking into large-format lithium-ion cells of capacities
                            exceeding 50 Ah for this purpose.<br>With higher energy content per cell, the number of cells and electrical connections in a battery pack would certainly decrease but the danger associated with individual cells of such high
                            capacity might be greater.<br> Hyundai Motor Company uses this type of battery in some of their hybrid vehicles,as well as Kia Motors in their battery electric Kia Soul. The Bolloré Bluecar, which is used in car sharing schemes
                            in several cities, also uses this type of battery.<br> Light aircraft and self-launching gliders are being produced such as the Alisport Silent 2 Electro and the Pipistrel WATTsUP. Some larger gliders such as Schempp-Hirth

                        <h5>One of the first things you will notice when shopping for cameras is that they come in various sizes. FPV originally started with pilots using PCB board cameras repurposed from security cameras, these already had an industry standardised
                            size and multirotor frames were designed accordingly. Eventually people realised that having all the electrical components exposed was an unnecessary risk and simple cases were created to house the PCB board cameras.<br>These
                            became commonly known as a HS1177 style camera, named after the board camera that was most commonly used inside. The HS1177 style camera is roughly 28mm square and is still a very common size format.<br>Many of the most popular
                            cameras from the main manufacturers continue to be made in this size, and accordingly, many frames are designed to accept this size camera. It is a common feature for the camera mounting points to be built right into the frame.
                            Due to the overall size of the HS1177 style camera, it is most commonly found in multirotors with a blade diameter of 5” or more.<br> As multirotor technology has progressed, components have become smaller and lighter, and
                            this has filtered through to cameras.<br>Manufacturers have created new smaller variants.<br> Naming conventions for the more compact cameras can vary a bit between manufacturers and websites, but most commonly the sizing in
                            descending order goes: HS1177, Mini, Micro, Nano/AIO.<br><br>

                            The Mini camera is roughly 21mm square and uses the same lenses and sensors as its larger counterpart, the hs1177 style Drone FPV Camera. This mini size camera has been less commonly adopted by frame designers mainly due to the odd width and minimal size
                            and weight difference.<br> The Micro camera is roughly 19mm square and most commonly has a bare PCB with a moulded front cover that allows the lens to be mounted. While on paper this seems like a
                            step backward in camera technology, this was a large advance for the multirotor industry. For the first time, a FPV camera with a good quality sensor and impressive light handling could be weighed in singular digits. Up until
                            the micro camera was released, smaller cameras typically suffered from poor light handling, that made it difficult to fly in changing light conditions. Arguably the view from the multirotor is the most critical feature, and
                            this limited most FPV enthusiasts to multirotors that were large enough to house a typical HS1177 camera. The arrival of the micro camera has assisted a huge explosion in the popularity of micro multirotors. Now the micro pilots
                            do not have to put up with sub-standard video quality.<br><br> As the camera name suggests the Micro camera is most often found in ‘Micro’ multirotors with blade diameters of 3” or less.<br>

                            The Nano/AIO cameras vary in shape and size more than any other standard of FPV camera. They are most commonly found in very small indoor multirotors like the hugely popular Tiny Whoop type machines.<br> Nano/AIO cameras have
                            gone largely unchanged in both size and performance since they were introduced, Typically the Nano camera is a press fit sensor cover/lens assembly over a PCB mounted sensor that is usually around 12mm square.<br><br> In AIO
                            cameras the name is an acronym for ‘All in One’. As the name suggests, an all in one camera usually contains all the required components for video transmission (Camera/VTX) in one compact unit. Again, sizes vary more in these
                            cameras than any other size standard in FPV but the most common are rectangular in appearance/layout with external dimensions of around 20mm wide, 13mm high, and 6-10mm thick (not including lens).<br> Usually the size camera
                            required will be dictated by the frame that you wish to fly, make sure to pay attention to what the frame designer/manufacturer recommends, and make sure that you buy a camera that is compatible. Usually you can adapt a smaller
                            camera to fit in a larger frame, but it is often impossible to fit a larger camera into a frame designed for a smaller camera.

                    <div class="content">
                        <h5>Aspect ratio refers to the shape of the image that the Drone FPV Camera captures. There are two options: 16:9 and 4:3. The shape of a 16:9 image is like a common LCD TV or computer monitor, a 4:3 image is like an old CRT television
                            and is more square. Neither aspect ratio is newer or better than the other.<br>Aspect ratio has very little effect on the image captured but you need to make sure that you match the aspect ratio of your camera to that of the
                            display screens in your goggles or HMD (head mounted display) to ensure the image displayed is not distorted.<br><br> Because FPV Goggles are often the singularly most expensive piece of equipment to be purchased by an FPV
                            enthusiastit is often not feasible to have different goggles to suit different cameras and therefore it makes sense to choose cameras that match your goggles native aspect ratio.<br><br> It is a common misconception that 16:9
                            cameras give you a wider peripheral (side to side) view than 4:3 cameras. This is actually false assumption, due to the maximum pixel ratio able to be transmitted by the camera and VTX back to the goggles, both cameras will
                            provide the same width image however the 4:3 camera will provide more image vertically.<br>This can be altered by changing the lens field of view used on the cameras but that will be discussed in further detail below.
                            <br><br> When choosing what aspect ratio Drone FPV Camera to purchase, consider your equipment and buy a camera that is going to the most compatible with what you already own. <br>Preferred aspect ratio is a personal thing

                        <h5>The sensor in your FPV camera is the component responsible for capturing the light/image entering the lens and converting that information into transmittable electrical signals.<br>There are two types of sensors used in FPV: CCD
                            and CMOS. The differences in the sensor technology is a very complex subject worthy of an article in its own right.<br>Rather than discuss the detailed specifics of the technology, this section will cover the basic attributes
                            of each sensor type and how that may impact your FPV experience.<br><br> Latency is the biggest enemy of FPV, latency refers to the delay caused by the time it takes for the camera to capture the light entering the lens and
                            process that information into transmittable electrical signals.<br>Any delay in the FPV system, means the multirotor will actually be ahead of where you see it through the goggles when flying.<br>When traveling at up to 100mph
                            even the slightest delay can mean that you hit that tree or race gate that you thought you could avoid.<br><br> Originally CCD cameras were considered superior because they have very low latency (around 20ms) and have very
                            good WDR (wide dynamic range) which allows them to see both light and dark areas without overexposing or underexposing either.<br> CMOS cameras typically either had high latency or very poor light handling.<br><br> At the time
                            of writing this article, CMOS cameras are becoming more popular. It appears the manufacturers have managed to reduce the latency to be comparable with CCD cameras and due to the nature of the sensor they can create a sharper/crisper
                            image that allows you to see more detail when flying.<br>The latest CMOS cameras are now including ‘Super WDR’ which is reportedly superior even to the light handling of the CCD cameras.<br><br> CCD cameras are still the most
                            commonly reliable option, if good light handling is important for where you fly (Low sun, in and out from under trees etc).<br> But, CMOS cameras are rapidly catching up and as mentioned have the capability to provide even
                            clearer FPV video.v Research reviews for whatever camera you are considering buying and you should be able to see flight samples that will help you make your decision.

                    <div class="content">
                        <h5>When searching for a suitable camera to put on your multirotor you will likely be offered more than one lens option.<br> Usually the lens options are given in millimetres and this number refers to the Focal length of the lens.
                            A larger number means the lens will have a narrower FOV (Field of View) and a smaller number will have a wider FOV.<br>Traditionally a 2.8mm lens has been the most commonly used and because of this, most camera manufacturers
                            were providing 2.8mm lenses with their cameras.<br>As multirotors have gotten faster, and flying has become more extreme, many pilots have found the 2.8 lenses too narrow and it was soon discovered that a GoPro replacement
                            lens would fit into the hs1177 cameras.<br>The GoPro lenses provided a great balance of having a wider FOV (roughly 2.5mm) and still being able to see details in the FPV feed.<br>.The GoPro lens modification was noticed by
                            manufacturers and now many cameras come with a 2.5mm lens option.<br><br> When choosing what lens you want to purchase remember, ‘less is more’ if you chose to have ‘less’ FOV you will see ‘more’ detail in the FPV video.<br>There
                            needs to be a balance of the two and if you try to fly with a very wide FOV it can be difficult to gauge your proximity to both objects and the ground, this can make it difficult to line up for racing gates or tree gaps etc.<br>Alternately
                            if you fly with a very narrow FOV it can be like trying to fly while looking through a cardboard tube, it is easy to focus on the details in front of you, but difficult to keep track of what is around you. 1.8, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5
                            and 2.8mm lenses are the most commonly chosen sizes.

                        <h5>Cameras have evolved significantly since the early days of repurposed security cameras, and along the way some manufacturers have taken the opportunity to add additional features to the cameras with the intention of simplifying
                            your build and allowing you easy access to more information.<br> The biggest advance for Drone FPV Camera features was the addition of a camera based On Screen Display (OSD) and this is now common in most popular cameras.<br>A
                            camera based OSD can let you display important information like battery voltage and ‘ON’ time to help you keep track of the length of your flights and the amount of battery that you have remaining. If you are choosing to use
                            a Flight Controller (FC) that does not have OSD capability then using a camera with built in OSD can make it much easier to keep track of your battery levels and Flight times.<br> Some Cameras include a microphone that can
                            be used to record the sound from the quadcopter perspective, usually this is just an incessant whine from the propellers, although some people find it useful to be able to hear what their motors are doing even if the quadcopter
                            is physically out of earshot. This can help with throttle control.<br>Most VTX’s have the capability to transmit a sound signal back to the FPV receiver in the goggles where you can listen to it using a headphone.<br> Night
                            Cameras: The cameras used for FPV are typically very sensitive to light and because of this can often operate in almost complete darkness if configured with the right lens and settings.<br>There are cameras specifically designed
                            for use in the dark available from a number of manufacturers, these can be great if you live in an area that gets very few daylight hours in winter, or if you simply want to take advantage of areas when most people are inside

                            it First Person View (FPV) racing. FPV lets the participants see a live camera stream right from the quadcopters nose. It’s viewed via an external screen or from head-mounted FPV goggles.<br> Racing frames exist for speed and
                            agility. They are not as aesthetically pleasing as freestyle quads though that’s subjective. The sole purpose of these quadcopters is to go as fast as possible in a race to the finish line.<br>Racing frames must be more aerodynamic
                            and lighter compared to the freestyle ones. The downside is that racing quads are compact and fiddlier to assemble and maintain.<br> Racing pilots try to shave every gram off their drone without losing its crash-resistance.
                            The stronger the build, the heavier the quad, so it’s quite a balancing act. Fine-tuning the performance is also part of racing and thus needs a different set of skills. There are no autonomous flight modes either, but then
                            it’s not necessary with racing rigs.<br><br> The stretched-X motor layout:-<br> A typical racing frame has a stretched-X motor layout with motors further apart front-to-back. Drone pilots usually place the batteries under the
                            frame rather than on top. An underslung battery saves space above and can thus use a smaller, lighter frame. A bottom-mounted drone battery also gives it extra protection against those inevitable crashes.

                        <h5>H & HX frames (freestyle):-<br> A true H frame is—as the name suggests—in the shape of an H. It provides the most space and is easier to build on. There’s plenty of room for a top-mounted battery along with extra components. You
                            can attach a lot to these frame types and still end up with a clean, uncluttered layout. It’s for these reasons that H frames are the favorite choice for freestyle drones.<br> The letters of an HX frame also define its shape.
                            There’s still the familiar H shape for the central body, but the four arms have an X layout.<br><br> True X frames (racing):-<br> The X frame design also has a specific purpose, and that is to reduce unnecessary weight. It
                            does this by using less material than a typical H frame design. A small center area (cross) also means there’s less room on top to play with. <br>That usually means compromises and perhaps a bit of cramming depending on the
                            quad. One must consider things like stackable video transmitters and 4-in-1 ESCs.<br><br> Stretch X frames (racing):-<br> The stretch X frame is almost the same as the X frame but with stretched arms. The design is such that
                            its wheelbase is closer to an ellipse than a circle.<br>This model provides less turbulence and better stability than the True X on its pitch axis. That makes it easier to control when cornering at higher speeds. It’s a popular
                            choice among racing enthusiasts even though it’s a tad heavier than the True X.<br> Most quad racers opt for True X and the Stretch X configurations of 180–220mm at 80g or less.<br><br> Plus frames:-<br> Plus-frames have not
                            caught on too well. They are in the shape of a ‘+’ and have an identical footprint to the X frame.<br>The problem with this style is that they break easier on impact than X frames. Also, the front motor gets in the way of an
                            FPV camera field of view (FOV).<br><br> Stretch plus frames:-<br> Stretch Plus frames came about to resolve the field of view issue with the Plus frames above. This design extends (stretches) the front arm to prevent the obstruction.
                            They’re still prone to breaking, though, when the front arm crashes into a hard surface.<br><br> Z frames:-<br> A Z-frame uses a stepped configuration where one base plate sits on top of the other. The stepped geometry reduces
                            turbulent air to the motors at the rear during forward flight.

                        <h5>There are a few other essentials to think about once you’ve decided on a frame. You should now know the size and configuration and what parts you intend to use. This section looks at the other things to consider before building
                            your quad. Here’s a quick breakdown of the six essential items:<br> 1.The Power Distribution Board (PDB)<br> 2.Standoff hole spacing<br> 3.Vibration dampening pads<br> 4.First Person View or FPV camera mount<br> 5.VTX mount<br>                            6.Motor Mount<br><br> 1. Power Distribution Board (PDB):-<br> Think carefully about the PDB as it’s a vital component and the centerpiece of your build. These tiny printed circuit boards provide all your quad’s electrical systems
                            with power.<br>Some flight controllers and Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) stacks work as PDBs. That’s good news for drone racers as it helps to keep the weight down. Get familiar with PDBs if you’re not sure what you need
                            or why.<br><br> 2. Standoff Holes:-<br> Standoff holes are a vital part of every frame needed to mount all the hardware components. You must know the size and configuration of the standoffs so that your parts can fit the model.
                            It’s a common newbie error to buy incompatible parts like stackable electronics and flight controllers.<br><br> 3. Vibration Dampening Pads:-<br> You don’t need vibration dampening pads to fly, but there’s every reason to get
                            them anyway. They guarantee better flight controller performance. These simple pads enhance the flying experience. They reduce noise, vibrations, and make tuning PIDs much easier.<br>The PID is a function from within the flight
                            controller responsible for flight stabilization. Shockproof pads are also popular for landing skids.<br><br> 4. First Person View (FPV) Camera Mount:-<br> Not all quad frames of equal size can accommodate the same First Person
                            View cameras. Make sure you check the FPV compatibility before you choose a camera. FPV mounts and brackets often come with frame kits which list the various camera options.<br> Some drone makers produce camera gimbals for
                            use with the popular GoPro Hero action cameras. The good thing about GoPro’s and other action cameras is their multiple uses.<br><br> 5. VTX Mount:-<br> VTX is short for video transmitter and a crucial part of any quadcopter
                            FPV system. It works by sending video from the drone’s FPV camera to a receiver. These receivers can display the live feed on a mobile device screen or via FPV goggles.<br> You must create a dedicated place for the antenna
                            if the frame doesn’t already have one. Antennas are the second most breakable/replaceable parts on any quadcopter after propellers.<br>Flexible antenna mounts are an excellent way to protect them from a hard impact. You also
                            need to figure out how to enclose the electronics. More exposure increases the risk of damage in a crash.<br><br> 6. Motor Mount:-<br> The frame must be able to support the motor size you choose. Refer to the table toward the
                            top of this page if you need guidance. You may also want to consider some protection for the motors though it will add to the weight. Always check and cross-check the components when building a drone from scratch. There’s nothing
                            more frustrating than buying parts that are incompatible for your frame.

                        <h5>The first thing on your mind should be the materials when picking the best frame. The materials play a significant role in determining the drone’s stability and efficient performance.<br>Note that vibration is increasingly a nuisance
                            in many drones, and if not managed well, it could lead to poor quality aerial images and possible damage to the electronic components.<br> Most frames are designed with carbon fibers because of its light weight properties.
                            However, the downside of carbon fibers is radio signal interference.<br>It is nonetheless a good material for your frame. To solve this, you must make sure that the radio and the antenna are connected effectively.<br> The other
                            commonly used materials include the aluminum and fiberglass. Aluminum, on the other hand, it’s a heavier metal to use on the frames, but it needs powerful motors. Although aluminum is more powerful and strong, it has a problem
                            of an inevitable vibration.<br> That’s why it is not commonly used. Meanwhile the fiberglass provides a great deal of not interfering the radio signals.<br>However, it comes second to carbon fiber in terms of stiffness and
                            rigidity, because it can bend to affect the stability of your drone. It appears that every material has its downsides.

                        <h5>An antenna is effectively a transducer; a device that transforms electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves. When an electrical current is passed through a wire a magnetic field is produced around the
                            wire.
                            <br>In two closely approximated wires carrying oppositely charged currents, the magnetic fields will be opposed and will essentially cancel each other out.<br>However, if the orientation of these positive and negative wires
                            is correctly manipulated, they will be capable of successfully propagating electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio waves.<br>In essence, this is an antenna. There is no particular difference between a transmitting antenna
                            and a receiving antenna, any antenna may be used for either purpose. <br>However, appropriateness of the antenna selection should be carefully considered. Antenna suitability will be discussed later in the article.

                        <h5>The different types of Drone FPV Antenna radiation patterns can be divided into two categories based on the directivity of the beam; directional and omnidirectional.<br>Directional antennas are optimized for beaming a signal over
                            long distances and in a very specific direction. Omnidirectional, as the name suggests, are best suited for the radiation of a radio signal in as many directions as possible, but over a relatively shorter range.<br>The radiation
                            pattern of the directional antenna can be pictured as being conical, the point of the cone originating at the antenna. As the cone projects from the antenna it gradually widens, before eventually coming to an end.<br>Any object
                            within the range of this cone will be capable of receiving the transmitted signal, or transmitting its own signal to the receiving antenna.<br>Directional antennas are best suited for receiver-side applications, where they
                            can be positioned to allow optimal reception of the signal transmitted by the video transmitter.<br>As for omnidirectional antennas, their evenly distributed radiation pattern is shaped as if a donut has been slid over the
                            top of the antenna, the active site of the antenna surrounded by the donut.<br>The radiation pattern of an omnidirectional antenna can be clearly pictured as being particularly well dispersed in all directions around the antenna
                            except directly above and below the antenna.<br>An omnidirectional antenna is typically used with the video transmitter, as the omnidirectional antenna is well adapted to overcoming sudden changes in the attitude and direction

                        <h5>There are two varieties of antenna polarization: linear and circular. The key difference between linear and circular polarization is how the radiation pattern of their respective waves propagates. A linear antenna projects a wave
                            along a singular plane, vertical or horizontal. This type of polarization allows more energy to be conveyed, because the wave is simply moving in one direction.<br>However, penetration of obstacles is reduced due to the difficulty
                            a linear wave faces in navigating around an object that is within its plane of propagation. A circularly polarized antenna emits a wave in a corkscrew fashion, this type of wave periodically spirals through both the vertical
                            and horizontal plane.<br>As a result, the circularly polarized antenna is a more proficient contender for applications that require obstacle penetration; typical FPV park flying, for example.

                            antenna is commonly used in the radio transmitter and radio receiver. Occasionally, the monopole is used in conjunction with a video transmitter in micro size multicopters, as its low profile and light weight is favourable

                            <br> The pagoda is a more recently developed omnidirectional circularly polarized antenna. It is advantageous over the skew planar/clover leaf design due to its comparatively low cost and simple PCB construction. It is also
                            most popularly used as a video transmitting antenna, or as a video receiving antenna.<br><br> Helical:-
                            <br> The helical design is a directional circularly polarized antenna. The helical is optimal for use as a video receiver antenna during long range flights in which penetration must also be maximised. However, the bulkiness
                            of the helical can provide difficulty during safe transportation of the antenna and installation on the video receiver.<br><br> Patch:-
                            <br> A directional linearly polarized antenna. The patch is another directional antenna favored for use as a video receiver antenna. The patch is compact and rugged, making it easier to mount and transport than the helical
                            antenna. Patch antennas are often less expensive than the comparable helical.<br><br> Antenna Diversity:-<br> With antenna diversity two antennas can be used synchronously to achieve higher quality and more reliable signal
                            reception. For example, a directional linearly polarized antenna and circularly polarized omnidirectional antenna may be used in tandem to effectively obtain greater range in a certain direction while maintaining reception
                            if the quad is to pass out of range of the directional antenna.<br><br>
